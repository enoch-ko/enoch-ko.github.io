About me
------

I was born and raised in Hong Kong. Currently, I am studying Part III Mathematics (Theoretical Physics) at St John's College, University of Cambridge. Before that, I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Warwick.

Research
------

I am broadly interested in finding creative ways to test fundamental physics theories with modern astrophysical datasets. Recently, I've been working with [Tariq Yasin](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/yasin), [Harry Desmond](https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/harry-desmond), [Richard Stiskalek](https://richard-sti.github.io/) and [Matt Jarvis](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/jarvis) on constraining dark matter and gravitational models using galaxy kinematics, such as with [Renzo's rule](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/544/4/4288/8321687) and the radial acceleration relation (RAR).

Previously at Warwick, I also worked on some particle physics projects with the [ATLAS](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/epp/exp/atlas/) and [LHCb](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/epp/exp/bphysics/lhcb/) groups, and analysed epitaxial films with the [Surface, Interface & Thin Film Group](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/condensedmatt/surface/). More details can be found in my [full CV](../files/CV_PhDs.pdf). It is important to note that while I was very interested in the physics involved, these project choices may or may not have been motivated by the funded travels to CERN, Paris and Brussels ;)
