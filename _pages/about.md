About me
------

Born and raised in Hong Kong, I am currently studying [Part III Mathematics (Theoretical Physics)](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/maamastph) at St John's College, Cambridge. I am also a Physics Team Lead and Expert Project Manager at [Mercor](https://www.mercor.com/research/), where I build and review research-level training material for top AI labs such as Google, Meta, OpenAI, etc. Prior to this, I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Warwick.

In my spare time, I enjoy brewing some nice filter coffee, solving chess puzzles and indulging in night-long games of [Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong) (specifically [港式台牌](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B8%AF%E5%BC%8F%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E9%BA%BB%E9%9B%80), though I am finding less time for it these days...). I also own a mischievous cat -- [Doobi](./doobi) -- who wandered into my girlfriend's place around two years ago and stayed with us ever since.

Research -- Looking for PhD opportunities!

I am broadly interested in finding creative ways to test fundamental physics theories with modern astrophysical and particle datasets. Recently, I've been working with [Tariq Yasin](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/yasin), [Harry Desmond](https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/harry-desmond), [Richard Stiskalek](https://richard-sti.github.io/) and [Matt Jarvis](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/jarvis) on constraining dark matter and gravitational models using galaxy kinematics, such as with [Renzo's rule](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staf2004) and the [radial acceleration relation (RAR)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad2762).

Previously at Warwick, I also worked on some particle physics projects with the [ATLAS](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/epp/exp/atlas/) and [LHCb](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/epp/exp/bphysics/lhcb/) groups, and analysed epitaxial films with the [Surface, Interface & Thin Film Group](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/condensedmatt/surface/). More details can be found in my [CV](./cv). It is important to note that while I was very interested in the physics involved, these project choices may or may not have been motivated by the funded travels to CERN, Paris and Brussels ;)
