About me
------

I am currently studying Part III Mathematics (Theoretical Physics) at St John's College, University of Cambridge. Before that, I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Warwick.

Research
------

I am broadly interested in creative ways of testing fundamental physics theories with modern datasets. Recently, I've been working with [Tariq Yasin](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/yasin), [Harry Desmond](https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/harry-desmond), [Richard Stiskalek](https://richard-sti.github.io/) and [Matt Jarvis](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/jarvis) on constraining dark matter and gravitational models using galaxy kinematics, such as with [Renzo's rule](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/544/4/4288/8321687) and the radial acceleration relation (RAR).

Before that, I worked on particle physics projects such as
